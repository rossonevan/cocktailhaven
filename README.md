# Phase 1 Project - Evan Rosson & Daniel Cuzco

## Web Page Functionality

The web page we have created provides the user with 6 random cocktails on first visit/load of the website. Each cocktail is displayed as a button in a header near the top of the page. The user can interact with each button to display the contents of the cocktail contained inside. When a user clicks on the button, the details of that cocktail are displayed. The user can also add their own cocktails to the 6 existing ones by filling out the form at the bottom of the page. Once filling out the form, that cocktail the user just created will be added to the existing ones at the top of the page, displaying their details when clicked.

## Cocktail Details

When the user clicks on the button, the details of that cocktail are displayed. The details are displayed in this order: 
- The picture of the cocktail.
- The name of the cocktail.
- The type of glass the cocktail goes in.
- The ingredients of the cocktail.
- The instructions on how to make the cocktail.

## Submiting A Cocktail

Lastly, the user has the ability to submit their own cocktail. A form at the bottom of the page allows the user to input: 
- The name of the cocktail.
- The type of glass of the cocktail.
- The image of the cocktail.
- The ingredients of the cocktail.
- The instruction on how to make the cocktail.

The user must fill out each input in order to submit. Since these inputs from the user are identical to the details being displayed from the existing ones that exist on page load, the created cocktail can be added to the existing ones for the user to see.
